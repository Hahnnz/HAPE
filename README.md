# Human Movement Estimation ( HME )
Human Movement Estimation using MaskRCNN with KeyPointing


## Todo
- [X] Preparing needed
- [ ] Combine **[Mask-RCNN](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN)** & **[DeepPose](https://github.com/ys7yoo/deeppose)** Algorithms
  - [X] Test Mask RCNN   
  - [X] Test DeepPose      
  - [ ] Combine them
    - [X] Change DeepPose Training Model (Alexnet to ResNet) 
    - [ ] Combine DeepPose-Resnet with Mask-RCNN
  - [ ] improve Combined Algorithm
  - [ ] Predict MET Score Based on Calculating how mach it affect to humans' pose
